# Making new ECO & RESOLVE mocks



### Notes about the general process, using ECO as an example



- Number density, `n`, needed to calculate HOD parameters is obtained after applying geometry and redshift cuts and calculating the volume of the space carved out. 

  

- `.bgc2` files are particle and halo files obtained from simulation boxes after running a halo finder. 

  

- The boxesâ€™ ICs are set by re-scaling the present day power spectrum to the desired initial redshift of the simulation. **Note: The halo files we have are z=0.**

  

- The `.bgc2` files are used as input to the halobias code along with the HOD parameters and the output are `.ff` files, which contain galaxy positions and velocities.



The `.ff` files are required by `eco_mocks_create.py` to make mocks which involves:

- CLF & abundance matching with ECO to get M<sub>r</sub>.
- Matching to closest M<sub>r</sub> in survey to assign all other galaxy properties to mock galaxies.
- Carving out the geometry of the survey.
- Calculating redshift-space distortions and distances.
- Carrying out group finding and group mass assignment which also includes group galaxy type and group M<sub>r</sub> / M<sub>*</sub> being calculated depending on the type of abundance matching that was carried out.

### Steps run to make the new set of mocks from 8 boxes:



1. The HOD parameter values that match `n` of ECO down to RESOLVE B M<sub>r</sub> limit, **n = 0.0831 (Mpc/h)<sup>-3</sup>**, are shown below:

   | HOD parameter                                                | Value |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
   | log M<sub>min</sub>                                          | 10.81 |
   | ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%20%5Csigma%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)log M | 0.2   |
   | log M<sub>0</sub>                                            | 10.0  |
   | log M<sub>1</sub>                                            | 12.05 |
   | ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%20%5Calpha%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0) | 1.0   |

   

2. Halobias was run on `.bgc2` files, located in  `/zpool0/fs2/lss/LasDamas/Resolve/`, from boxes 5001-5008 for a specific halo definition (M<sub>200</sub>). The halobias script used was `halobias_so_part_extra`located in`/fs1/masad/Research/Repositories/RESOLVE_Statistics/data/raw`.  This was originally `halobias_so_part` located in`/fs1/szewciw/galaxy_clustering/codes/bin` , but it was modified to include three additional columns that are required to execute the mock-making script - `halo_mass`, `central_satellite_flag`, and `halo_id`.



> Sample halobias executable run:
>
> `./halobias_so_part_extra 3 4 1 10.81 0.2 10.0 12.05 1.0 1 0. 1. outputfile.pnm -1 /zpool0/fs2/lss/LasDamas/Resolve/5003/rockstar/so_m200b/*.bgc2 > /fs1/masad/Research/Repositories/RESOLVE_Statistics/data/raw/ff_files/m200b/5003_200b_outfile.ff`



3. Resulting `.ff` files located in `/fs1/masad/Research/Repositories/RESOLVE_Statistics/data/raw/ff_files/m200b` were required as input to `eco_mocks_create.py` located in `/fs1/masad/Research/Repositories/ECO_Mocks_Catls/src/data/mocks_create`.

4. Since mocks **without** the buffer region were required, the cz ranges in `eco_mocks_create.py` were modified (lines `2250` and `2251`). `RA` and `DEC` ranges remained the same. 



> Sample  execution of `eco_mocks_create` for ECO :
>
> `make clean`
>
> `make delete_mock_catls`
>
> `make CPU_FRAC=0.30 COSMO_CHOICE="Planck" HALOTYPE="m200b" REMOVE_FILES="True" SURVEY="ECO" catl_mr_make`

### Additional notes:

- The steps above can be reproduced for RESOLVE by changing the `survey` argument value.
- The script has been modified to run on all 8 boxes automatically.
- The resulting mock catalogs are located in `/fs1/masad/Research/Repositories/ECO_Mocks_Catls/data/processed/TAR_files/Planck/m200b` as `.tar.gz` files.
